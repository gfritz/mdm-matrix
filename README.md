# mdm-matrix

## Install Steps
- git clone https://github.com/gfritz/mdm-matrix.git
- cd mdm-matrix
- Start the emulator in another terminal (or tab if you are using Guake!) 
	-- /usr/bin/mdm-theme-emulator
- If it works in the emulator, copy it to the mdm themes directory
	-- sudo cp -R ~/my-mdm-html5-theme /usr/share/mdm/html-themes
- Open the login screen settings through the menu or this way:
	-- sudo /usr/sbin/mdmsetup
- Pick the theme, but it sadly does not work at the login screen.

## This is where you come in!
It works in the browser (easy), and in the emulator (good sign).  But the login screen is just boring.  Probably the canvas is just not in the right place; I do not know.
